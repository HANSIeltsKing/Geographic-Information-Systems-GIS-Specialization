**Question 1 When a layer becomes “time enabled,” what happens?**
1 / 1 point

Geoprocessing results on the layer can be rolled
back on time-enabled layers

**Dates and times are read from a field in the
layer, enabling ArcGIS to display features only from a specific time frame.**

A new, empty field that can hold dates or times
is added to each row in the feature class

An editing interface to change what time each
feature represents appears.
Correct

Time-enabling a layer causes ArcGIS to read the
times from a field on the layer and use that to filter the currently displayed
features to a time you select. For more information, review video Time Enabled Data.

**Question 4 When you create a new project in ArcGIS Pro, which of the following does it also create? Check all that apply.**
1 / 1 point

A web map for the project

**A folder for the project**

One of the big changes in ArcGIS Pro is that Map
Documents are now project documents that live in their own folder with other
resources. For more information, review
video ArcGIS Pro. 

**A toolbox for the project**
Correct

For more information, review video ArcGIS Pro.   

**A default geodatabase for the project**
Correct

Each project has its own geodatabase, making it easier to associate temporary files generated for a project with the correct project and enabling a smart default location to save data. For more information, review video ArcGIS Pro.

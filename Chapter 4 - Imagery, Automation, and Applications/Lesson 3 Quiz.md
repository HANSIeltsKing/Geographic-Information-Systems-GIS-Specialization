**Question 1 For what reasons might you use ModelBuilder? Select all that
apply.**
1 / 1 point

**To formalize a process so it can be repeated later or improved by others**
Correct

Models can make sure that an analysis repeated at some time in the future or by someone else are achieved the same way and are therefore comparable. For more information, see video "What is ModelBuilder?" 

As an alternative way to run a single geoprocessing tool

**To plan out or share a workflow with a coworker**
Correct

Models a great way to communicate how a task was accomplished. For more information, see video "What is ModelBuilder?"

**To automate something that needs to happen many times**
Correct

Models can be great for running tasks that need
to happen repeatedly, or for iterating through datasets. For more information, see video "What is ModelBuilder?"

**Question 2 What does it mean when an item in a model has a shadow
behind it?**
1 / 1 point

That the tool is ready to run

That the tool is a model parameter

**That the tool has already run**

That the tool failed to run
Correct

A tool whose output exists and is ready for the next tool will have a shadow behind it. For more information, see video "What is ModelBuilder?"

**Question 3 When running a model as a geoprocessing tool (not from the
canvas), how can you make a specific output show up in your table of contents?**
1 / 1 point

**By making it a Model Parameter**

By selecting the correct option when creating the toolbox

By dragging it from the model canvas to the table of contents

By selecting the Add to Display option on the variable
Correct

In order to have a layer returned to your table of contents, you must specify the location for it to be stored as a model parameter. For more information, see video "What is ModelBuilder?"

<br/>

**Question 4 What does the Make Feature Layer tool do when used in a model?**
1 / 1 point

Converts a raster layer to a feature layer.

Enables feature classes to be used in the model

Adds a feature class to the table of contents as a feature layer

**Loads a feature class as a feature layer that can be used similar to a table of contents layer for selections**
Correct

For more information, see videos Setting Up a Larger Model and Using Interface Tools as Geoprocessing Tools in ModelBuilder.

**Question 5 When a model branches (has multiple linear processes running
alongside each other), but you need to make sure the second branch completes
before a certain step in the main branch, how can you force your model to
follow that need?**
1 / 1 point

Using the Extent environment setting to narrow
the model to a specific area.

**Using a Precondition that connects the output of
an item in the secondary branch to the item it needs to finish before in the
main branch.**

By making the end of the second branch a Model Parameter.

By forcing the secondary branch to be an unnecessary input to a tool in the main branch.
Correct

For more information, see video Feature Layers and Selections in Models.

**Question 6 When making a ModelBuilder tool reusable by others, how can you allow for someone else to provide the input features or rasters to be used as parts of the model?**
1 / 1 point

**By making a variable a Model Parameter so it will show up in the geoprocessing dialog**

By removing any values specified for a variable so it needs to be filled in at run time.

By creating variables for input to the first
process in the model

By designating a variable as “managed” so it can
be managed by the person running the model
Correct

For more information, review video Branching, Preconditions, and Viewing Progress Interactively.

**Question 7 Of the following items, what can models not
be exported or copied to?**    
1 / 1 point

Python code that can be edited and incorporated into other Python code.

A graphic that shares the model’s sequence and structure  

A new geoprocessing tool that can be run on
another computer

**A new feature class to use in a map**
Correct

For more information, review video Advanced Models and Exporting Models to Python.

**Question 1 If a raster named random_raster_10m
contains random values generated by the Create Random Raster tool, what will
the following raster calculator expression result in: (random_raster_10m * 20) – 10 ?**
1 / 1 point

A new raster with values between -180 and -200

A new raster with values between -1 and 1

A new raster with values between -5 and 5

**A new raster with values between -10 and 10**

A new raster with values between 0 and 1
Correct

Since the values start out between 0 and 1, when
we multiple the values by 20, we get values between 0 and 20, and then when we
subtract 10, we get values between -10 and 10. For more information, see video Create Normal/Constant Raster.

A raster named new raster containing the values
of conditional raster in cells where the value of true raster is less than 10
and the value of false raster otherwise.

A raster named new_raster containing the values of conditional_raster in cells where the value of conditional_raster is less than 10 and the value of false_raster otherwise.

A raster named new_raster containing the values
of conditional_raster in cells where the value of conditional_raster is less
than 10 and the value of true_raster otherwise.

**A raster named new_raster containing the values
of true_raster in cells where the value of conditional_raster is less than 10
and the value of false_raster otherwise.**

A raster named new_raster containing the values
of true_raster in cells where the value of true_raster is less than 10 and the
value of false_raster otherwise.
Correct

Conditional raster is evaluated to see which cells are less than 10. Cells that meet that expression are replaced with the corresponding value in true_raster in the output and cells that don’t meet that expression are replaced with false raster in the output. For more information, see video Con/Set Null.

**Question 3 Why
do we use the Set Null tool instead of the Con tool when using an expression to
remove values from a raster?**
1 / 1 point

Con is too general and more confusing for this use case.

**The Con tool cannot output Null values, so we
use Set Null for that specific case.**

The Con tool changes values to NoData and Set
Null changes them to Null.

Set Null is faster than the Con tool for this
purpose.
Correct

There isn’t a way to output Null values with Con, so Set Null provides us with similar capabilities to Con, but in a way that outputs Null values. For more information, see videos Map Algebra/Raster Calculator/Overlaying Rasters and Con/Set Null.

**Question 4 For which of the following reasons might you use an alternative tool like Geospatial Modelling Environment (GME)? Select all that apply.**
1 / 1 point

**To use a tool not available in your copy of
ArcGIS** 
Correct

Some tools in Geospatial Modelling Environment are only available there and don’t have analogs in ArcGIS. For more information, see video Geospatial Modelling Environment.

**For added functionality compared to the same tool in ArcGIS**
Correct

GME combines ArcGIS and R in order to add options and functionality to tools. For more information, see video Geospatial Modelling Environment.

Because you don’t have any license for ArcGIS

**To generate randomized datasets for sampling**
Correct

GME has a number of tools that can generate randomized sampling locations within a study area. For more information, see video Geospatial Modelling Environment.

**Question 1 What does the azimuth
parameter on the Hillshade tool control? Feel free to look at the Hillshade
tool’s contextual help in ArcMap if you don’t know.**
1 / 1 point

The scaling of the Hillshade’s values vertically

**The direction of the sun on the compass rose
relative to raster (360 and 0 being the sun north of the raster, 180 being the
sun south of the raster)**

The height of the sun in the sky

How the Hillshade is combined with the DEM for cartographic blending.
Correct

The term “azimuth” refers to the direction of a
celestial object (such as the sun or moon), relative to some observer. For more information, review video on Hillshade.

**Question 2 Which of the following does not affect how a Hillshade
appears?**
1 / 1 point

The Hillshade layer transparency

The “Model Shadows” checkbox in the layer tool

**The Hillshade’s attribute table**

The color ramp used for the Hillshade and for
the DEM.
Correct

The raster attribute table for the Hillshade is
not a factor in how the Hillshade is displayed.For more information, review video on Hillshade.

**Question 3 What does a line on a topographic or contour map represent?**
1 / 1 point

Buffered distances away from a mountain peak.

A trail up or along the hill

The most gradual slope up a hillside

**A line of fixed (equal) elevation on the
landscape**
Correct

Contours trace outlines of hillsides in a way that allows you to visualize the slopes and elevations, but the lines themselves are the same elevation along the line. Different lines represent different elevations. For more information, review video on Contours.

**Question 4 In a Viewshed analysis, what do the pixels in the resulting raster represent?**
1 / 1 point

How popular a location is with tourists, based
on GPS data

How beautiful the view in that pixel is, based
on a suitability analysis

Accessibility of the pixel from the road
network, based on DEM and road data

**Whether the pixels can be seen from a set of observer locations, based on a DEM**
Correct

A Viewshed is a measure of the visibility of a
location from a specific set of observed points.For more information, review
video on Viewshed.

**Question 5 What analysis does the Cut Fill tool perform?**
1 / 1 point

Cut Fill extrudes a raster surface, then outputs
a new raster with the change from the original

Cut Fill assesses the minimum and maximum height
differences between two raster surfaces

Cut Fill assesses the cell size and location
differences between two raster datasets

**Cut Fill assesses the location and volume of
changes between two surface models**
Correct

Cut fill analyzes how a raster changes over time, as characterized by two rasters system. For more information, review video on Cut Fill.

**Question 1 When is it advantageous to
use the project tool to rewrite the features of a data layer into a new
projection?**     
1 / 1 point

**When you have layers of
data with different projection types.**    

To adjust how the data is
displayed on the screen because the scale is wrong.    

When the data does not have
the necessary level of precision for the current task.    

When the data has errors.    
Correct

It can be helpful
to have all layers in the same projection format and the projection tool is a
way to accomplish this. If you don’t keep all of your data in the same
projection, ArcMap will reproject it behind the scenes because it needs the
coordinates to be in the same coordinate system.

**Question 2 Which of the following
statements best describe the Geoprocessing tool set in ArcGIS?**    
1 / 1 point

Geoprocessing takes a
projection and displays it on the users screen.    

Geoprocessing tools communicate with ArcCatalog to manage available data types 

**Geoprocessing tools let the user run functions that transform or analyze their data through one or many operations on the data.** 

Geoprocessing is the
interface which programmers use to update ArcGIS.    
Correct

Geoprocessing
encompasses a wide variety of tools in ArcGIS and let the user transform their
data in effective ways.

**Question 3 What does the Intersect
Tool do?**    
1 / 1 point

The Intersect Tool outputs
the differences between two layers.     

**The Intersect Tool returns the common area of the layers provided to it as a new layer.**

The Intersect Tool returns
the common area between the selected layer set and the basemap    

The Intersect Tool creates a join for two or more layers and outputs the combined layer. 
Correct

The Intersect Tool does indeed return the common area of layers provided to it as as new layer.

**Question 1 What does an edit session allow the user to do?**
1 / 1 point

**An edit session allows the
user to make changes to data, without using a separate tool like Field
Calculator, and allows the user to revert changes if a mistake is made.**     

An edit session reverts
changes made by the Field Calculator tool, much like the undo function in other
programs.     

An edit session moves symbology, but does not
affect the underlying data.

Edit sessions are the only
way to change data within a feature class.     
Correct

An edit session does indeed allow the user to make changes to data and reverse those changes if a mistake is made.

**Question 2 When might a GIS analyst
manually digitize data? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

When copying data from one
GIS to another.     

When changing projection
systems within ArcGIS.    

**When adding aerial imagery
into a GIS.**    
Correct

Aerial imagery often needs to be digitized to have distinct features useable by the GIS.    

**When converting paper maps
to digital.**    
Correct

Many paper maps
have already been digitized, but it is still a task required of many GIS users.

**Question 3 When digitizing data, what
is the snap feature of ArcGIS used for?**    
1 / 1 point

**The snap feature aligns a
feature being digitized with a nearby, preexisting feature.**     

The snap feature will
automatically detect edges of a new feature based on the basemap.    

The snap feature corrects
errors in digitizing based on the last vertex created.    

The snap feature is not
related to digitizing.    
Correct

It removes a
margin of human error when digitizing features that share boundaries and allows
for creating proper topology for the data.

**Question 4 Which of the following
might have a null value as a valid data entry? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

Elevation for a town at sea
level.    

**Voting data for a precinct
that was not yet entered and is not known by the person who currently has the
data.**    
Correct

This would indeed be a valid entry.

**A population value attached
to a county that has not been counted.**    
Correct

This would indeed be a valid entry.

**An unknown value for the
income of residents in an area.**    
Correct

This would indeed be a valid entry.

**Question 5 What does the Display XY
Data tool do?**    
1 / 1 point

Display XY Data lets the
user enter a latitude and longitude coordinate pair and zooms the view pane the
data extent.    

Display XY Data can be used
to fix ArcGIS layers that are not projected in the proper coordinate system.    

**Display XY Data allows
the user to create points from a CSV file that includes latitude and longitude
coordinates by identifying which fields within the CSV contain the coordinates
for latitude and longitude as well as the coordinate system that those points
are in.**    

Display XY Data takes a projection
and converts it to XY coordinate data which can be saved to a CSV file.     
Correct

Correct.

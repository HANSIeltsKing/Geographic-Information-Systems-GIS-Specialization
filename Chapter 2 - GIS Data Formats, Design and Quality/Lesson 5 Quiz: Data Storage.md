**Question 1 What are the benefits of a
Feature Dataset? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

**Helps keep data organized.**
Correct

Though
organization isn’t a primary goal of the feature dataset, it is one benefit.    

**Enforces projection and
coordinate system constraints.**    
Correct

This is the primary reason
to use feature datasets.    

The Feature Dataset is the
only place that can hold Feature Classes.    

**Improves data integrity by reducing
user errors.**    
Correct

By forcing data to stay in
a required projection, it can reduce data integrity errors in data used by
groups.

**Question 2 What are the benefits of a
file geodatabase? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

**The size limits on File
Geodatabases are huge, and will likely not be hit by any project you work on.**    
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a file geodatabase.

**File Geodatabases block
users from editing the same file at the same time.**     
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a file geodatabase.

**File Geodatabases allow
multiple users to edit the data within different feature classes at the same
time.**    
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a file geodatabase.

File Geodatabases make sure
that all projections are in the same format.

**Question 3 What are the benefits of a
personal geodatabase? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

**A Personal Geodatabase has
a lock feature to prevent multiple users from editing data simultaneously.**    
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a Personal Geodatabase.

**A Personal Geodatabase can
contain all necessary features and raster to send a dataset to another user in
a single file (provided the dataset is not over 2GB).**    
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a Personal Geodatabase. Personal Geodatabases are great
containers, too.

A Personal Geodatabase can
be created in Microsoft Access to allow for easier editing of table data.    

**A Personal Geodatabase can
be easily edited in Microsoft Access.**    
Correct

This is definitely one benefit of a Personal Geodatabase.

**Question 4 Which of the following
pieces of information are stored in the .dbf portion of a shapefile? Check all
that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

The spatial drawing information for ArcGIS to
display the shapefile.

**The shapefile’s data table.**    
Correct

The shapefile’s
data table is stored in the .dbf file.    

Information on the
projection of the shapefile.    

The shapefile’s metadata.

**Question 5 Which of the following best
describes the formula for finding the percentage that two datasets (A and B)
overlap – the percent overlap?**    
1 / 1 point

Intersection of A and B,
divided by the area of A or B (whichever is smaller).    

The sum of A and B.     

Area of A divided by area of
B.    

**The intersection of A and
B, divided by the union of A and B.**     
Correct

By dividing the
areas common to both datasets by the total area of those datasets, the user
will find the percentage that they overlap.

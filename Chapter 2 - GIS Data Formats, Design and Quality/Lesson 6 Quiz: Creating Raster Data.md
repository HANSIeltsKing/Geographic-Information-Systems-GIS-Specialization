**Question 1 Which tool would you select
to create a raster where each cell is populated with its distance to a
feature?**    
1 / 1 point

Path Distance Tool.     

The Conditional Pick Tool.     

The Distance Raster Tool.    

**Euclidean Distance Tool.**     
Correct

This is the tool that you would select to create a raster where each cell is populated with its distance to a feature.

**Question 2 What is the purpose of georeferencing?**     
1 / 1 point

Georeferencing lets the
user convert a feature to a raster or rasters.     

Georeferencing creates
reference points on a polygon that allows the user to map another feature over
that feature.     

Georeferencing lets the
user put reference data (metadata) directly into a feature so that  the new
information is displayed spatially alongside the raster.    

**Georeferencing lets the
user apply spatial reference points to aerial imagery so that ArcGIS can
properly display the raster.**     
Correct

Georeferencing
allows us to bring rasters that don’t have any spatial location information
included into GIS and add the appropriate location information.

**Question 3 Which of the following
statements best describes the output of the following raster calculation?**    

*(“raster_1” == 78) | ((“raster_1” < 50) & (“raster_1” > 10))* 
1 / 1 point

The raster calculator would
create a new raster substituting the value 1 for all cells of raster_1 that
equal 78 and 0 for all of the others.    

**The raster calculator would
return a new raster with that value of 1 for all cells of raster_1 that are between
10 and 50 or equal to 78. It would have a value of 0 for all other cells.**    

The raster calculator would
return an error because this is not valid code for the raster calculator.     

The raster calculator would
return a new raster with all of the cells having the value 1 because all
numbers are either greater than 10 or less than 50.    
Correct

The raster calculator would indeed return this option.

**Question 4 What is the purpose of the
Zonal Statistics as Table tool?**    
1 / 1 point

The Zonal Statistics as
Table tool takes two feature classes and converts them to a raster displaying
any item their data tables share in common.    

The Zonal Statistics as
Table tool is a way to calculate the area of features.

The Zonal Statistics as
Table tool lets the user take data from a feature table and attach it to a
raster occupying the same spatial location.     

**The Zonal Statistics as
Table tool lets the user attach summary information from a raster to the data
table of a feature class that overlaps that raster.**     
Correct

The Zonal Statistics as Table tool does let the user attach summary information from a raster to the data table of a feature class that overlaps a raster.

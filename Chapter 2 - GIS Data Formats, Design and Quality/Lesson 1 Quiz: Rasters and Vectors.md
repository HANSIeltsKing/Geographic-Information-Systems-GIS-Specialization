**Question 1 For many calculations,
vector data can be slower, but more accurate. Why is this?  Check all that apply.**     
1 / 1 point

**Vector data can be slower to perform calculations on because unlike raster data, the computer cannot simply compare values, it must first perform a series of calculations to determine relationship.** 
Correct

Vector data is slower because of the calculations it needs to perform.

Vector data can rapidly
change projection systems, allowing calculations to be made more rapidly.    

**Vector data is more
accurate because it represents the data as points, lines and polygons, it does
not chunk it into units of a uniform shape.**     
Correct

The use of points, lines, and polygons does make vectors much more accurate than rasters.

Vector and raster data both
use the same tools. In ArcGIS the tools have been optimized for vector data,
making it the most accurate choice.

**Question 2 If your data is a set of
shapes such as buildings or water features, the vector data type might be a
good option because ______________.** 
1 / 1 point

Vector data is made of a
grid and allows complex data shapes such as buildings to be loaded more rapidly.

Vector data is stored as
lines, not polygons which increases the precision of the display.     

Vector Data is not a good
option to display shapes such as buildings or water features.    

**Vector data stores shapes
and boundaries well vs raster data which must break data into a grid and causes
a greater loss of precision.**     
Correct

Vector data does store shapes and boundaries well as opposed to having to break out the data into a grid which ends up causing a loss of precision.

**Question 3 Which of the following are valid ways to represent the area of a city? Check all that apply.**

1 / 1 point

A line.

A point.

**A polygon.**
Correct

A polygon is the
most accurate way to represent the boundaries of a city, it shows where it is
on the map and contains information about the exact boundaries of the city.     

**A raster.**
Correct

A raster could be
used to visualize a theme across a city, or as aerial imagery to depict what a
city looks like.

**Question 4 How many values can be stored with each cell of a single raster?**
1 / 1 point

**Question 5 In order to determine the area of a raster made up of a certain value (for example all of the values that correspond to an elevation of zero, or a land cover type of ice) the user needs to know the count of each value and _____________.**
1 / 1 point

The color associated with the cell.

What each cell means.

Convert the raster data to vector data and
calculate the area.

**The cell size.** 
Correct

You can determine
the total area by multiplying the number of cells containing a certain value by
the square of the cell size.

**Question 6 Which of the following scales represents the “largest scale” map?**
1 / 1 point

1:30,000

1:1,000,000

1:15,000,000

**1:100**
Correct

1:100 is the largest scale map in this list.

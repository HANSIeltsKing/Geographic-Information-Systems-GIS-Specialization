**Question 1 Which of the following are
types of uncertainty in GIS work? Check all that apply.**    
1 / 1 point

**Representation**    
Correct

The methods chosen
to represent the data can introduce uncertainty into the data.    

**Measurement**
Correct

The devices used to collect
data impact the accuracy of the data. The level of uncertainty this brings is
important to consider because it informs the type and precision of analysis
that can be performed.    

**Conception**
Correct

Having a clear idea of the
problem is necessary in order to create a valid workflow and identify
uncertainty.     

**Analysis**
Correct

Choices of how to perform
an analysis impact the outcome. It is important to recognize the choices made,
and how those tradeoffs affect the uncertainty of the results.

**Question 2 Which of the following
statements regarding uncertainty is true?**     
1 / 1 point

A dataset cannot have a
bias since it is made of numbers without human interference.     

**A dataset may not
accurately represent each record contained within it, rather it is a
representation of the aggregate.**     

If a dataset is available,
it means that the individual records have been accurately aggregated and can be
treated as one unit without adding uncertainty.    

Raster datasets reduce
uncertainty by adjusting cell size to portray variation within an individual
record    
Correct

It is important to consider the ecological fallacy when approaching a dataset. For example the average age of an area may be thirty. This could lead the analyst to make one set of assumptions about the population assuming that most people are in their late 20s to mid-30s. In reality the area may be mostly populated by people in their 40s -50s raising children aged 0-10. These two populations likely have different needs and interests, but would show up the same in an average population field.

**Question 3 Why is topology important
in a GIS?**    
1 / 1 point

Topology lets the user
optimize for speed while testing data, at the expense of increased rates of
errors.     

**Topology information helps
prevent data errors and can speed up calculations.**     

Topology is how the user
can display elevation information when doing cartography in ArcGIS.    

Topology is the processes
for creating a topographic map.     
Correct

Topology is important within a GIS for this reason.

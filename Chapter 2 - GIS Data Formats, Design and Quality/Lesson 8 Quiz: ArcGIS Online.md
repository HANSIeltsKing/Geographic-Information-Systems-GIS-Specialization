**Question 1 When is it useful to divide
one attribute by another while doing symbology?**    
1 / 1 point

If there are not enough
data points to display, it can be divided by another attribute to reduce
uncertainty.    

If the data are too large to display.

**If the data are more valid
as a ratio for an analysis, for example population/area gives population
density which would be more useful for determining if an area is urban or
rural.**     

It is not useful to divide attributes for
symbolical purposes.

Displaying
attributes as a ratio can show different information than simply displaying

**Question 2 What can be gained by
changing the scale at which icons and labels are displayed?**    
1 / 1 point

**Hiding labels and icons
allows the user to only see information that is relevant at the current map
scale.**    

Hiding labels and icons is
useful to keep small items visible at large, zoomed in, scales.    

ArcGIS Online is only able to display limited numbers of icons, so it is necessary to set the
scale that at which to display each icon.    

Normally data is corrupted
when the user scrolls too far into, or out of, the map. Hiding labels and icons
keeps the data intact.     
Correct

Making conscious
decisions regarding what labels and icons should be displayed and at what scale
allows the map creator to keep the map uncluttered and display only relevant
information at each scale.

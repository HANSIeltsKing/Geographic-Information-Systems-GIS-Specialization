<br/>

All of the following questions will ask you for values from your 
parcels layer for the new town. They ask you to look up values by 
OBJECTID and field, so that you can validate that you're getting the 
correct answer.

You will need to retrieve these values from your final analysis layer - *before* you exported it to ArcGIS Online. The process of exporting to a shapefile can change the OBJECTID values, so you won't be able to look up the correct values.

1 / 1 point

Select by Location and Stencil

Cut and Split by Location

**Select by Location and Intersect**

Intersect and Stencil
Correct

**Question 2 What
is the function of the Erase tool?**
1 / 1 point

**The Erase tool removes the polygon area of one layer from another.**

The
Erase tool removes duplicates within
the attribute tables of two layers.    

The Erase tool removes the selected layer from the map.

The
Erase tool removes attributes with specific
names or IDs from a layer.
Correct

**Question 3 In
which of the following situations might the Buffer,
or Multiple Ring Buffer be a good
choice. Check all that apply.**
4 / 4 points

**Determining safe locations to locate housing
and schools based on distance from a polluting facility.** 
Correct

The air pollution caused by a
factory would be a good use case of the Buffer
tool if there is only one distance that needs to be accounted for, or the
multiple ring buffer if there are multiple distances.

**Determining which houses in a neighborhood
can hear a music performance at a nearby outdoor amphitheater based on a known
travel distance for each volume level.**
Correct

The noise pollution caused by an
event would be a good use case of the Buffer
tool if there is only one distance that needs to be accounted for, or the Multiple Ring Buffer if there are multiple distances with differing actions.

**Determining what type of transportation a
resident might need to use to find fresh produce based on known travelable
distances for different modes of transportation (Ex. walking, biking, or
driving).**
Correct

The Multiple Ring Buffer tool is a good fit for determine locations that are within a series of distances from a known point.

**Determining how far a person or animal could
have traveled from a set starting location, after 1, 2, or 5 hours.**
Correct

The Multiple Ring Buffer tool is a good fit for determining maximum travel distances after set periods of time if you know the travel speed

**Question 4 What
is the function of the Near tool?**
1 / 1 point

**The
Near tool takes in two layers (A and
B). For each feature in layer A, the ID of the nearest feature within layer B
is attached to the attribute table of A.**

The
Near tool and the Buffer tool are functionally identical.

The
Near tool outputs a table showing the
distance from one feature to all other features within a specified distance.

The
Near tool takes in two layers (A and
B). For each feature in layer A, it calculates the distance to the closest
three features within layer B and attaches it to the attribute table for layer
A.
Correct

**Question 5 The
Dissolve tool is a form of_________.**
1 / 1 point

Interpolation

Selection

**Generalization**

Isolation
Correct

The Dissolve
tool allows the user to aggregate data upwards and create a more general map by
removing boundaries between features and merging multiple features into one.

**Question 6 Which
of the following statements regarding the “Processing Cell Size” option present
in many geoprocessing tools (such as the Tabulate Area tool) are true?** 
1 / 1 point

**It is available on geoprocessing tools that
perform their calculations in raster form, whether inputs are vector or raster.** 

It
has no effect on the calculation time of the tool.

Increasing
the cell size will lead to a higher resolution output with less error. 

It is
only present on geoprocessing tools that exclusively take raster data as inputs.
Correct

**Question 7 Why
is it useful to create graphs with data from ArcGIS?** 
1 / 1 point

ArcGIS
graphs are strictly inferior to ArcGIS maps.

**Data from
the attribute tables can often have a non-spatial relationship and a graph is
good way to display that information.**

ArcGIS graphs have less errors than maps.

Data from ArcGIS cannot be exported, so
ArcGIS graphs are the only method of showing data which does not belong on a
map.
Correct

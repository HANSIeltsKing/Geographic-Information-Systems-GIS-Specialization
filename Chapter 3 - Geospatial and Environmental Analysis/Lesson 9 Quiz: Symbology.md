For more examples please revisit the video **Binning/ Classifying Data.**
1 / 1 point

Provides a way to specify the percentage points at which each classification becomes the next classification

Brings up a dialog to specify the colors used for the data samples.

**Brings up a dialog where you can specify how many records ArcGIS should process to determine the possible range of values to symbolize.**

Brings up a dialog that allows you to specify attributes to subset the data displayed in the map.
Correct

**Question 3 What does the Histogram Equalize stretch method within the symbology tab do?**
1 / 1 point

Histogram
Equalize fits the color ramp based on how many standard deviations away
from the mean a value is.

**Histogram Equalize
fits a curve on the color ramp such that in areas with a large number of
values the color changes rapidly, and in areas with a small number of values
the change is more gradual.**

Histogram Equalize fits a straight line across the values with the
lowest value representing the lowest value and highest representing highest. It
is based on the value of the record, not on the number of records with that
value. 

Histogram
Equalize allows the user to draw a curve on the histogram and equalizes the
values based on that entry.
Correct

**Question 4 When
might it be valuable to import symbology from a previous project and keep the
themes the same? Check all that apply.**
2 / 2 points

**When
the projects will be presented together and need a unified theme.** 
Correct

Keeping a unified theme can be important to
create professional documents. 

**When the projects represent similar data types
and convey similar information.**
Correct

It can
save time and reduce error to use a previous symbology set if you are making a
similar map.

When the layers use different datatypes, but you want to load the colors from one to the other

Importing
symbology is not valuable because it is important to tailor the symbology
exactly to the data each time.

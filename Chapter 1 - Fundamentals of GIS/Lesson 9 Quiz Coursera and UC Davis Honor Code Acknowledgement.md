**Question 3 The following questions all ask you to imagine a scenario and specify how you would follow the honor code.**

**If you worked with two other people to develop a solution to an assignment for this course and want to submit the work, which of the following situations follows the honor code? (Choose as few or as many as are correct)**
1 / 1 point

**You all decide together on the steps to take in GIS to complete the analysis. You each run the analysis separately, develop your own maps, and submit separate work.**
Correct

It's OK to work together and discuss options and solutions, you may not give each other answers and cannot submit any results that someone else provided you or that you found online. Running and submitting your own results is important if you discuss how to run the analysis with others

You all decide together on the steps to take in GIS to complete the analysis. One of your friends runs it and shares the results with you so you can submit it. You note in your assignment submission that you worked together with others as a group.

**Question 4 Scenario: While searching for help on an assignment, you come across a link to someone's portfolio where they posted the work they did for this class. Choose any actions that follow the honor code. (Choose as few or as many as are correct)**
1 / 1 point

Download their results and maps, modify it to include your name and the date so it's your own work, and then submit it in this course. 

Download their results and maps, inspect them to understand how they did the assignment, then use that to recreate the assignment on your own and submit your own version.

**Briefly admire their work before leaving the page and asking for help elsewhere.**
Correct

Correct - this is the only appropriate course of action because each of the others, despite their modifications, amounts to copying the work of someone else.

**Question 5 Scenario: In this course, you will grade your peers and they will grade you. Select all of the following situations that violate the honor code**
1 / 1 point

A question in the discussion forum that details someone's confusion about the assignment, and a reply that tells them how to solve the specific problem and proceed.

**An assignment submission you see while reviewing your peers that looks similar or identical to the previous submission you reviewed.**
Correct

Correct - if you see work that you suspect is plagiarism, or work that is clearly trying to circumvent the requirements of the course (such as by submitting irrelevant material), please "flag" the submission for course staff - we will then review it and determine if action must be taken - you don't need to worry about incorrectly flagging something because we will always review it, so flag it if you think it might be plagiarized. If we determine an assignment is plagiarized, the person who submitted it will be permanently banned from the course, and will be banned from Coursera if they repeatedly violate the honor code in other courses.

A post in the discussion forums with a link to an assignment requesting additional reviews.

**A question in the discussion forum that asks for the steps to solve a portion of an assignment.**
Correct

Correct. This one is most likely an honor code violation. Asking for *specific* help with a single step would be appropriate, but asking for step by step instructions is not.

For example, posting "I tried running the Intersect tool, but my results don't appear to be correct - now I'm not sure what to do next and would appreciate some guidance" would be appropriate, but posting "what steps should I do for the assignment" is not.

**A post in the discussion forums with a link to an assignment requesting additional reviews and promising to review you highly in exchange.**
Correct

Correct - this is a clear honor code violation. You must always grade people on the basis of their work, not on other things they have promised or have done. Please report the discussion forum thread to Coursera in the menu for the thread.

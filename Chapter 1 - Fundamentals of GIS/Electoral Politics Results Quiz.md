Instructions

The first two questions in this quiz require you to get the sum or total of an entire column in your attribute table - this is a value you will need to derive from your attribute table, not a single value within it. 

The remaining questions will ask you for values for specific counties - either the total number of votes cast in the county, or the number of yes votes. You can obtain this after you correctly run your spatial join as instructed in the assignment. These answer will be a single value from the attribute table

**Question 1 What is the total number of votes in the election? You can take this from either the county-level data or the precinct data (though the precinct data is more accurate)**

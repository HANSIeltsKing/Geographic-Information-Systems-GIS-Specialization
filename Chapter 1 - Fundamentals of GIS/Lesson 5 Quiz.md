**Question 1 What is the difference between data frames and layers?**    
1 / 1 point

A layer is a complete map in itself, data frames nest within layers to display the data for that layer.     

Data frames are the results of geoprocessing, layers are imported by the user.     

A data frame is the equivalent of a layer when it is displayed in layout view.     

**Data frames are complete maps to themselves and only one can be displayed at a time in data view. Layers are individual sets of data displayed within a data frame.**      
Correct

Data frames can also be thought of as containers that hold layers.

**Question 1 What is a projection?**
1 / 1 point

The distortions caused by
displaying three dimensional data on a two dimensional surface.    

A model showing projected
values of a data set after a set amount of time.     

A type of map file used to
share data after geospatial analysis has been performed.     

**A projection is a way to
display three dimensional information on a two dimensional surface like a
computer screen or a map.**     
Correct

Projections are
necessary for us to work with data about our (mostly) spherical earth on a two
dimensional surface

**Question 2 At a fundamental level, what do geoprocessing tools do?**    
1 / 1 point

Geoprocessing tools
automatically select input data based on what the user defines as output data
and performs calculations.    

Require the user to write
extensive computer code to perform tasks.     

Combine features with a
map, but nothing else.     

**Take input spatial data
defined by the user, perform a set of operations to aid in analysis or
management and produce a set of output data.**     
Correct

Geoprocessing
tools are a critical part of analysis workflows.

**Question 3 How do environment variables affect geoprocessing?**     
1 / 1 point

Environment variables are
used by one and only one input to a geoprocessing calculation.     

An environment variable is
an unknown value used to temporarily store data in a geoprocessing operation.    

**Environment variables are
an additional set of options that affect the output of a geoprocessing tool.**    

Environment variables are
used when making environmental calculations such as greenhouse gas emissions,
or average rainfall.    
Correct

Environment
variables help set the analysis environment
and can define common behaviors and properties of geoprocessing tools. Environmental variables can also be
set globally within an ArcGIS session to affect all geoprocessing tools within
that session.

**Question 4 What does the spatial join tool do?**    
1 / 1 point

**It attaches information
from one feature classâ€™ attribute table to another based on their spatial
relationship.**    

It redraws features so that
they are connected in the display window.     

It combines two or more
features based on their non-spatial information such as name, or a unique
identification code.     

It is a cartographic tool
to visually display that two items are connected in time or space.     
Correct

Spatial joins help
us understand relationships between data layers. They merge the attributes of
layers based on their respective locations to each other.
